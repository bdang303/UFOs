# UFOs
Javascript

## Overview of the project
This project utilizes JavaScript functions to enhance an HTML code in order to build a dynamic and interactive web page. Our webpage first displays data in the form of a table from a database of UFO sightings and contain various details such as date, location, and sighting description.
In addition to that, we are adding various filters that allow the user to input values that update the results reflected in the table. Lastly, we also utilize Bootstrap to creatively style and structure the elements noted on the webpage

## Results

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Below is a mock up of the webpage design and structure. The top of the webpage contains high-level context on the subject, UFO Sightings.

As you scroll down on the webpage, youÕll find that there is a table that reflects various sightings of UFOÕs. The sightings are detailed by date, city, state, country, and UFO shape. All of these data elements can be interactively filter by the user depending on what sightings they are most interested in. Here the user has the ability to input values into any of the available filter fields, and upon pressing return or enter, the table will dynamically update to reflect the search results.

## Summary
With the addition of these filters, there are a few design drawbacks.
- The table will not update unless a user selects a new field. 
- Adding a spell checker for each field entry to ensure users are inputting a valid option. 
- Displaying a list of suggestions as users input each character would be a great enhancement.
